CX Project 4242

Resource For the Datamap library we are using: 

https://github.com/markmarkoh/datamaps/blob/master/README.md#getting-started


Things Left To Do: 

So if you're familiar to Git Hub; feel free to branch off master and play aroudn with things! If not; I wouldn't bother trying to get to know it; Just download the whole directory, make changes, communicate them then I'll help update the "master" directory.

Tasks: 

	Visualization:

- Make the tooltip reflect the value for each state

Will involve making a global dictionary thats updated during "updatechoropleth()" to values like {'ALASKA':'Value'} 

- Take a look at our per-capita values

For some the min is negative... plus its really hard to see color differences with such a small set. Alot of things look like we weren't using any energy until the 80s


-Fix highlight color 

Right now it highlights orange; I just want the border highlighted


- Still need population data 1960 - 1964 (or we just forget those years, whatever) 

CSS-Tasks: 

1. Make slider actual time line; incorporate the energy events 

2. Make the page look pretty (possibly using bootstrap (css library for rapid site development (our class website uses it )))
